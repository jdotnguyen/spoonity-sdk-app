# spoonity-sdk-app
App built using the Spoonity SDK.

## About
A personal project I built using the Spoonity SDK. It's built in NativeScript using Angular 7.

## Installation
Simply run `npm install` and then `tns preview` assuming you have NativeScript CLI installed locally, otherwise run `npm install -g nativescript` before running the preview command.

## Notes
You must provide your own vendor ID if you're a client and replace it in `vendor.config.ts` found in `app/shared/vendor.config.ts`.
